## AI Access & Privacy

Answer to: "Do you have access to my entire codebase and can see the contents of all my files?"

- No. I only have access to the files that are part of this repository/workspace in the current session. I cannot see anything outside of this project directory on your machine unless you explicitly add or share it here.
- I can read files that you include in this repo (and any content you paste into the chat), as well as metadata surfaced by the provided tools (e.g., file lists, diffs, search results) within this workspace.
- If you want me to review additional code or files, please add them to this repository or paste their contents.

This clarification is provided to ensure transparency and privacy when collaborating with the AI assistant.
